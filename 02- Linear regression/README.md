# ðŸ§  Linear regression
Linear regression is a type of supervised learning algorithm, its primary function is to fit a linear model to predict numerical values.

## ðŸ“Œ Detailed explaination
Suppose you want to predict the miles per galon based on a car's heaviness. You would plot a graph with MPG on the y-axis and car's heaviness on the x-axis. You would then fit a linear model.  
In ML terms this equation is equivalent to $y' = w_1 * x_1$
- $w_1$ is the weight
- $x_1$ is the input feature
- $b$ is the bias

However, if we have multiple features (n) to use to predict our label then our previous equation would then look like: $y' = w_0 * x_0 + w_1 * x_1 +w_2 * x_2...+w_n * x_n + b$
